This lovely bird is a [**Mariana crow (_Corvus kubaryi_)**][mariana_crow][^1]. Unfortunately, by 2011, the Mariana crow was **extirpated** from Guam[^2], its main habitat. The [International Union for Conservation of Nature](https://www.iucn.org) has rated the bird as being [**"critically endangered"**][iucn_redlist].

> ### Status and conservation[^1]
>
> On Guam, the Mariana crow's decline is primarily due to predation by the introduced [brown tree snake (_Boiga irregularis_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_tree_snake). In spite of protection of nesting-sites by electrical tree barriers, the remaining birds are considered to be reproductively senescent. On Rota, many other threats endanger the crow, including homestead development, resort and golf-course construction, agricultural settlement, nest-predation from introduced rats, the [Mariana monitor lizard (_Varanus tsukamotoi_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_monitor), typhoons, predation from feral cats, disease, and competition with the [black drongo (_Dicrurus macrocercus_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_drongo). More recently, the brown tree snake has also been detected on Rota, likely leading to serious declines in the Mariana crow population there if the snake population establishes itself. The Mariana crow is also persecuted by residents of both islands who see it as an obstacle to development.[^3]
>
> In 1993, a [National Wildlife Refuge](https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=Guam_National_Wildlife_Refuge&params=13_39_2_N_144_51_38_E_type:landmark) was established on Guam to preserve the remaining forest, and birds were translocated from Rota. Biologically controlling the brown tree snake is also being discussed.
>
> Crows were transported from Rota to Guam in 2003 to assist conservation efforts though this may have had the unintended side effect of decreasing genetic variation within the species as tests have shown the Rota population is less diverse than the Guam.[^4]
>
> Formerly classified as an endangered species by the IUCN,[^5] it was suspected to be rarer than generally assumed. Following the evaluation of its status, this was found to be correct, and it is consequently uplisted to critically endangered status in 2008 as it is in immediate danger of extinction, numbering so few birds that it could be entirely wiped out by a single catastrophic event such as an epidemic of [West Nile virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Nile_virus).[^3][^6]

[Sigh...] Poor human beings, be nice to the earth. :worried:
